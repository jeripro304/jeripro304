No semiconductor to work above 40Ghz (Thats why it took time to rise from 2G to 5G)

Day 2



signal is less while in lift or inside in a room because the electromagnetic waves will be grounded bacouse of those metals such that the signal to the phne 
in the outside the signal is of 1 watt whereas the signal inside the area will be of  less of 0.1 db
