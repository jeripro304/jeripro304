Dear Subhasis,

I trust this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inform you about an upcoming family event that necessitates my presence in my native place. My brother's marriage is scheduled for 15/12/2023, and I must attend this significant celebration.

In light of this unavoidable family commitment, I kindly request your understanding and approval for a leave of absence during this period. I understand the importance of the upcoming FTE conversion process, and I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition.

Given the circumstances, I propose rescheduling the FTE conversion process to Monday, 18/12/2023, or any other dates that are preferable for you.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding of the importance of family commitments. Please let me know if there are specific steps or procedures I should follow to formalize this request.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]



Hi Souvik,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I have an unavoidable family ceremony to attend, and as a result, I will need to leave the company at 3:30 PM today. Additionally, I would like to let you know that I won't be available tomorrow and the day after tomorrow as I'll be in my native place.

Thank you for your understanding.
